All the code required to execute this project should be contained in this zip file

robot_odo.p has been replaced with robot_odo.m This is important, the code will not be good with the given odometery function

To create a new nursey, either replace the Generate nursery script with a new script by the same name (or just edit it) or relace the call to generateNursery() in the script with a different call.
